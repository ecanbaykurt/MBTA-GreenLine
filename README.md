Features and Findings
We investigate first an overview of the MBTA light rail/subway system and measure it's reliability/consistency via the headway metric. After that, we focused on the Green B line and tried to identify "problem stations". We then performed a calculation to get a sense of how headway changed from station to station. This led to us noting that the stations with the most inconsistent headway tended to be at intersections that were abnormally structured, affecting traffic and the train's speed.
